# Overview

`stree` is a CLI tool designed to visualize the directory tree structure of an S3 bucket.  
By inputting an S3 bucket/prefix and utilizing various flags to customize your request, you can obtain a colorized or non-colorized directory tree right in your terminal.

Whether it's for verifying the file structure, sharing the structure with your team, or any other purpose, `stree` offers an easy and convenient way to explore your S3 buckets.

# Features

- **Colorized Output**: By default, `stree` provides a colorized tree structure, making it easy to differentiate between directories and files at a glance. This feature can be turned off with the `-n` or `--no-color` flag.
- **LocalStack Support**: `stree` supports local testing with LocalStack, a fully functional local AWS cloud stack, thanks to the `--local` and `--endpoint-url` flags.
- **Custom AWS Profile and Region**: Specify the AWS profile and region with the `--profile` and `--region` flags to override the default settings as needed.
- **Ease of Installation**: Install `stree` via Go, Homebrew, or by downloading the latest compiled binaries from the GitHub releases page.
- **Depth level Specification**: With the new `--L` flag, you can now specify how many levels deep in the directory structure you'd like to visualize. This offers a more focused view, especially for large S3 buckets.
- **Role Switching Support**: `stree` is now enhanced with the ability to switch AWS roles with MFA using the `--mfa` flag. This makes it easier to manage and view S3 buckets that require different IAM roles for access.
- **Environment Variable Support**: `stree` now prioritizes environment variables for AWS Profile and Region settings. The tool will use the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable if set, falling back to the `default` profile otherwise. Similarly, it will use the `AWS_REGION` or `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` environment variables for the AWS region, if available. (see [AWS CLI Environment Variables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html) for more information)
- **Full Path Display**: With the `-f` flag, the full path of each file is now displayed in the output, making it easier to identify the location of each item within the S3 bucket.

# How to Use

> [!WARNING]
>Prerequisite  
>You must set up the config and credentials to be used with aws cli in advance

From here on, it is assumed that the config and credentials are set as follows.

```shell
~/.aws/config
[my_profile]
region = ap-northeast-1
output = json
```

```shell
~/.aws/credentials
[my_profile]
aws_access_key_id=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
aws_secret_access_key=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

## Basic Commands

Specify the bucket name and profile, and execute the following command. The profile is specified with `--profile (-p)`.

```shell
stree my-bucket -p my_profile
```

You will get the following output.

```shell
my-bucket
└── test
    ├── dir1
    │   ├── dir1_1
    │   │   └── dir1_1_1
    │   │       ├── file1.csv
    │   │       └── file2.csv
    │   └── dir1_2
    │       ├── file1.csv
    │       ├── file2.csv
    │       └── file3.csv
    ├── dir2
    │   └── dir2_1
    │       └── dir2_1_1
    │           ├── file1.csv
    │           ├── file2.csv
    │           └── file3.csv
    └── dir3
        ├── file1.csv
        └── file2.csv

9 directories, 10 files
```

## Specifying Prefix

```shell
stree my-bucket/test/dir2 -p my_profile
```

The result of executing this command is as follows.

```shell
my-bucket
└── test
    └── dir2
        └── dir2_1
            └── dir2_1_1
                ├── file1.csv
                ├── file2.csv
                └── file3.csv

4 directories, 3 files
```

## Overriding Region

You can specify the region with `--region (-r)`. Use the `--region` flag to override when you want to specify a region other than the one listed in the profile.

## Usage with Localstack

It can also be used with Localstack. When using it with Localstack, the endpoint and region are set to the following by default.

```shell
endpoint = http://localhost:4566
region = us-east-1
```

Since the majority of cases are expected to use the above settings, we have added a flag for Localstack, which is `--local (-l)`.

```shell
stree my-bucket/test/dir2 -l
```

In case you need to change the endpoint and region due to special circumstances, you can override with `--region (-r)` flag and `--endpoint (-e)`.

```shell
stree my-bucket/test/dir2 -r us-east-1 -e http://localhost:4537
```

## Disable Color Output

You can disable color output with `--no-color (-n)`.

<p align="center">
With color
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="img/color.png" alt="with color" height="auto" width="auto"/>
</p>

<p align="center">
Without color
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="img/no-color.png" alt="without color" height="auto" width="auto"/>
</p>

## Specifying Depth Level

You can specify the depth level with `--level (-L)`. The default is 0, which means that all directories are displayed.

```shell
stree my-bucket -p my_profile -L 3
my-bucket
└── test
    ├── dir3
    │   ├── file1.csv
    │   └── file2.csv
    ├── dir1
    │   ├── dir1_1
    │   └── dir1_2
    └── dir2
        └── dir2_1
```

## Role Switching Support

You can switch roles with MFA using the `--mfa` flag. This makes it easier to manage and view S3 buckets that require different IAM roles for access.

To use this feature, you must first set up the config and credentials to be used with aws cli in advance.

```shell
[profile dev_david]
source_profile = my_profile
# MFA device
mfa_serial = arn:aws:iam::820544363308:mfa/david_mfa_device
# Role to assume
role_arn = arn:aws:iam::820544363308:role/david_role
```

see [Assume AWS IAM Roles with MFA Using the AWS SDK for Go](https://aws.amazon.com/jp/blogs/developer/assume-aws-iam-roles-with-mfa-using-the-aws-sdk-for-go/) for more information

And then execute the following command.

```shell
stree my-bucket -p dev_david -mfa
```

Also, if you wish to operate with a profile that assumes a role, you can specify it using the `--profile (-p)` flag, without the need for MFA.

```shell
[profile dev_david]
source_profile = my_profile
# Role to assume
role_arn = arn:aws:iam::820544363308:role/david_role
```

And then execute the following command.

```shell
stree my-bucket -p dev_david
```
